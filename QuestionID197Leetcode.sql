+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

-- Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The query result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
-- Explanation: 
-- In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
-- In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

-- Code
with t as (Select *, Lag(temperature) OVER (Order BY recordDate) as 'PrevT', Lag (recordDate) OVER () as r
From Weather),

f as 
(
    Select *, DateDiff(recordDate, r) as k
    from t
)
Select id from f
where k=1 AND temperature>PrevT
